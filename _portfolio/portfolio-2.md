Very early in to my research career, I worked on a collaborative study  between Indian Institute of Technology (IIT Bombay) and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) for my Master thesis and calibrated the microsimulation package VISSIM to mixed traffic conditions in India. 
[During this study](https://trid.trb.org/view/1242159), I was able to understand the importance of traffic microsimulation and the need to represent the reality adequately.

It is important to study and model human behaviors in traffic simulation, which are an essential part of the reality. I continued this endeavor in my [PhD dissertation work}(https://trid.trb.org/view/1438850) (2013-2018), where I studied models from psychology and identified key human factor parameters that can be measured and incorporated in traffic microsimulation. 
Recently (2022), [I have developed a microsimulation framework](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/03611981211068460) to represent CAVs effectively and assess their impact on traffic congestion. Along with traffic engineering, understanding human factors from traffic psychology perspective can help to reduce accident rates, improve driver assistance systems etc. 

As Traffic Psychology and Traffic Engineering continue to develop as two separate fields of research, one of my long-term interests has been to seek out collaboration and funding opportunities to identify the common goals between these two fields for future research. 
To address this topic, I have written research needs statement and cowritten triennial plan as the member of TRBâ€™s Committee on Road User Measurement and Evaluation (ACH50).
