Managing the I-STREET emerging technologies program at UFTI has given me an opportunity establish professional relationships with state and local agencies as well as industry partners. 

I have:

Worked with the policy makers in Florida to obtain legislative recognition  for the I-STREET program [(FL Senate Bill 64 and House Bill 425, 2023)](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/64). 

Developed and launched the [industry partnership program at UFTI](https://istreet.ce.ufl.edu/industry-council/)(2023) with paid memberships from early-stage small companies to large and well-established enterprises. 

Established more than 80 industry connections and hosted 40 of them on “Industry Showcase” events with public agencies and DOT partners. I have worked with [more than 10 testing partners on I-STREET](https://www.eng.ufl.edu/istreet/wp-content/uploads/sites/163/2023/07/Partner-Logo-blue-bg-greyscale_Blue-background.png). 

Co-organized two marquee industry events (Comotion Miami Mobility Challenge and Florida Plugfest) which is unique for an academic researcher.
