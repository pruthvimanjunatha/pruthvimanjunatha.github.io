1.	Vehicle – Along with AVIAN researh group at UFTI, I develop and test Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) technologies. I conduct research on the design of effective in-vehicle devices and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). I have and would like to continue to collaborate with FHWA's program for Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA).
   
2.	Infrastructure – I conduct research on signal optimization using connected vehicles, evaluating pedestrian and bicyclist safety applications, and developing simulation frameworks for analyzing the impact of CAVs. DOTs are investing in emerging technologies through multi-million-dollar infrastructure projects. It is vital to assess the effectiveness of the technologies being deployed.
 
3.	Road user – As part of the human factors group at UFTI, I conduct research on the effect of smartphones on drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists’ safety through connected vehicles, perception and use of autonomous shuttles and the impact of user interface designs on road users. The transition from a traffic full of conventional, human driven vehicles to "Level 4 or 5" full autonomous vehicles would involve many intermediate steps where human understanding and comprehension is a key factor. Working with TRB ACH50 and ACH 30 committees, human factors is one of my priority research areas.
