Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) commissioned a study (2013-2019) to [evaluate the impact of adaptive signal control strategies](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/65581) on eight different corridors in Florida. As a project lead, this gave me an opportunity to visit local traffic management centers and work with traffic managers, county, and state representatives on one-to-one basis. 

As the CAV penetration increases, it is important to develop signal optimization methods to to fully utilize their capabilities. In the recent years (2021-2023) I have been working on [practical implementation of a bi-level signal/trajectory optimization system](https://youtube.com/shorts/Ul-JS1_7ndk?si=e89cQaPD4JGuKSu9) for mixed traffic with both conventional vehicles and CAVs called Realtime Intersection Optimizer (RIO). The system was tested recently as part of Florida Plugfest , a CV2X connected vehicle testing event that I helped organize.
