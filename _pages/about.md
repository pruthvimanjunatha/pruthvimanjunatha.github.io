I am a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Coastal Engineering at the University of Florida and I manage the [I-STREET emerging transportation technologies program](https://istreet.ce.ufl.edu/about).

I have more than ten years of experience in transportation engineering, which includes teaching, research and working in the industry. My expertise lies in the fields of Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) infrastructure, Human Factors and Driver Behavior, Traffic Simulation, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), traffic operations and data management.

**I-STREET (Implementing Solutions from Transportation Research and Evaluation of Emerging Technologies)**

I-STREET is a “living lab” on the University of Florida’s (UF) campus, surrounding roadway networks, and across the state of Florida. Advanced technologies such as autonomous vehicles, smart devices, and sensors are tested and deployed to enhance mobility and safety. I-STREET is a collaboration between the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), the City of Gainesville (CoG), and University of Florida’s Transportation Institute (UFTI) to further advance transportation technology development
and deployment.
